# twitterSentimentAnalysis
Twitter Sentiment Analysis is designed to evaluate and categorize the emotional tone expressed in tweets. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this project processes large volumes of tweet data to classify sentiments into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral. The analysis involves several steps, including text preprocessing (like tokenization and removal of stop words), feature extraction using methods like TF-IDF, and training machine learning classifiers to accurately predict sentiment.
